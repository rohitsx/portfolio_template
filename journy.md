[7/30/2025, 9:30 a.m.] I have started DSA through w3schools currently I'm at this [page](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_intro.php) let's see where I will tomorrow ![7-30-25_9-35-am]

Sections I learned:

- [Simple Algorithm](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_simple.php)
- [Arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_data_arrays.php)
- [Time Complexity](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_timecomplexity_theory.php)
- [Bubble Sort](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_bubblesort.php)

[7/30/2025, 9:10 a.m.] I am continuing my dsa from bullbleSort since it was completed yesterday I'm preceding selection sort [here](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_selectionsort.php)

Sections I learned:

- [selection sort](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_selectionsort.php): I usually first write my own draft then see the solution, my first chose was swap method the the tutorial used push, insert, pop. later in the blog mentioed swap is more efficient happy to see my solution was the best case.

[8/1/2025, 6:25 a.m.] start my day with building a ui component

[8/1/2025, 8:58 a.m.] DSA is really getting me curious about a lot be stuff I did very small research, like what is time complexity of sql and no-sql I was surprise to find the have O(n) time complexity, where as key-value pair like object, json or redis has O(1) since the use hashmap underthe hood. this got me more curious how google is able to make search so fast and bunch of other stuff are the using hasmap (I still have to learn more about it). I really want to build my own search engine if I got time to do it.

[8/2/2025, 8:02 a.m.] yesterday I spended almost 5hr working the ui component, which is still ÓÅ†pending. I couldn't do DSA yesterday and I think it won't be possible today since I have alot of things to do.
My today goals:

- Finish the Ui component, since primitive part was completed yesterday, all I have to day all I have do is styling, docs and some formalities which could esaliy take 5-6 hr.
- If I get some time after that I would like to look into remotion. Since it is very niche so there would be less demand and competition, It would be less challenging for me to get client and I personally have interest in make video programmatically.
- I don't think I be able to do this but I won't change the ui of my protfolio and make some improvment on it.

[8/2/2025, 8:05 a.m.] Yesterday I completed the ui component gig.
[8/2/2025, 9:00 a.m.] Back to the daily routine starting DSA with [Insertion Sort][https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_insertionsort.php]
[8/2/2025, 9:55 a.m.] Today I couldn't get my fouce on DSA I will it again wher I left of from tomorrow

[8/2/2025, 9:00 a.m.] I have decied not to Do DSA strigth 3 hr I will make it 2 hr for now. again start with [Insertion Sort][https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_insertionsort.php] 


[8/5/2025, 9:00 a.m.] Idk why above dates are all messed up but I will not doing DSA today Ik I'm losing but yeah, not in the mood today.
[8/5/2025, 4:18 p.m.] Started learning Expo

[8/6/2025, 12:23 p.m.] Life got hectic, yesterday, I got a call from my potential client. he was very friendly and easy to talk to, we have no agreement yet but it is small step toward my goals. now life got interesting after that not sure what to do now yesterday I got another message from a founder on linkedin and he is also intrested and he will send some paid work for me to complete to get the full time job. the things become real hectic when I thought the lindine guy did not liked my portfolio and he ghosted me so I create a demo video of repli Ai to share to him since the ui is good but never shared him the video cause I thought the project is not really that good, so I just made a post not shared him on the inbox but interestingly another founder saw the video we did call and discussed about some my projects (repli AI and jobfitresume). he liked the project and asked me to join he company. he said let do a call in evning for more details. now I'm not sure what to do for my first meeting I was a lot nerves, he very friendly, second guy also was pretty fun to talk to he listed all my ideas and works very seriously and some how he said he relate to me since he was doing the same things as me 5-6 years ago, made me real happy, since I'm alone from day one in this journey and I don't have a background where I can meet a lot of fellow developer. So I never know what I'm doing is right or wrong, I keep asking same question I'm I doing enough? do I need to work more hard? I'm just avg and not special, can I achive my goal that I have always dream of. Ik this went a lot but this how my internal monolog works. third guy was also very casual talked me in hindi I shared my work after talking with me he said why don't join us just like that. also my all nervousness lost after I talked to the second guys.

I have a lot to say like waht I thinking and what I want to build now untile I get any solid gig or thing but I'm tiered of writing so I will talk a break now.
