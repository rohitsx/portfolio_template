[7/30/2025, 9:30 a.m.] I have started DSA through w3schools currently I'm at this [page](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_intro.php) let's see where I will tomorrow ![7-30-25_9-35-am]

Sections I learned:

- [Simple Algorithm](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_simple.php)
- [Arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_data_arrays.php)
- [Time Complexity](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_timecomplexity_theory.php)
- [Bubble Sort](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_bubblesort.php)

[7/30/2025, 9:10 a.m.] I am continuing my dsa from bullbleSort since it was completed yesterday I'm preceding selection sort [here](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_selectionsort.php)

Sections I learned:

- [selection sort](https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_selectionsort.php): I usually first write my own draft then see the solution, my first chose was swap method the the tutorial used push, insert, pop. later in the blog mentioed swap is more efficient happy to see my solution was the best case.

[8/1/2025, 6:25 a.m.] start my day with building a ui component

[8/1/2025, 8:58 a.m.] DSA is really getting me curious about a lot be stuff I did very small research, like what is time complexity of sql and no-sql I was surprise to find the have O(n) time complexity, where as key-value pair like object, json or redis has O(1) since the use hashmap underthe hood. this got me more curious how google is able to make search so fast and bunch of other stuff are the using hasmap (I still have to learn more about it). I really want to build my own search engine if I got time to do it.

[8/2/2025, 8:02 a.m.] yesterday I spended almost 5hr working the ui component, which is still ÓÅ†pending. I couldn't do DSA yesterday and I think it won't be possible today since I have alot of things to do.
My today goals:

- Finish the Ui component, since primitive part was completed yesterday, all I have to day all I have do is styling, docs and some formalities which could esaliy take 5-6 hr.
- If I get some time after that I would like to look into remotion. Since it is very niche so there would be less demand and competition, It would be less challenging for me to get client and I personally have interest in make video programmatically.
- I don't think I be able to do this but I won't change the ui of my protfolio and make some improvment on it.

[8/2/2025, 8:05 a.m.] Yesterday I completed the ui component gig.
[8/2/2025, 9:00 a.m.] Back to the daily routine starting DSA with [Insertion Sort][https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_insertionsort.php]
[8/2/2025, 9:55 a.m.] Today I couldn't get my fouce on DSA I will it again wher I left of from tomorrow

[8/2/2025, 9:00 a.m.] I have decied not to Do DSA strigth 3 hr I will make it 2 hr for now. again start with [Insertion Sort][https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/dsa_algo_insertionsort.php] 


[8/5/2025, 9:00 a.m.] Idk why above dates are all messed up but I will not doing DSA today Ik I'm losing but yeah, not in the mood today.
