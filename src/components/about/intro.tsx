    <p>Hello! Thanks for visiting my personal page.</p>
    <p>I'm Rohit. I’m a web developer who enjoys working on both the frontend (the part people see and interact with) and the backend (the behind-the-scenes logic that makes everything work). I’ve worked with tools like React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, and I’m also learning more about Web3, Solana, and Ethereum to expand my skills into the blockchain space.</p>
    <p>I really like building apps that are clean, simple, and user-friendly. Whether it’s designing smooth UIs with React, setting up servers with Express, or experimenting with WebRTC and Socket.IO for real-time communication, I love making projects that feel fast and useful.</p>
    <p>I’m curious by nature, always learning something new—whether that’s diving into TypeScript, setting up databases on Atlas, or exploring how crypto wallets and smart contracts work. At the same time, I believe in keeping things simple and practical, both in code and in communication.</p>
    <p>I’m excited about creating projects that connect people, whether through extensions, real-time apps, or SaaS tools. My goal is to keep improving, collaborate with others, and build products that actually make a difference.</p>
    <p>Looking forward to what’s ahead!</p>
    <p>
      Best,
      Rohit
